/**
 * Bubble Sort is the sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements 
 * if they are in the wrong order. After each iteration or pass, the largest element reaches the 
 * end (in case of ascending order) or the smallest element reaches the end (in case of descending 
 * order). The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. This algorithm is not 
 * suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case complexity are of ÎŸ(n^2) where n is 
 * the number of items
 * 
 * Example:
 * arr[] = 64 34 25 12 22 11 90
 * 
 * Iteration 1:
 * (64 34 25 12 22 11 90) -> (34 64 25 12 22 11 90), Here, algorithm compares the first two elements, and swaps since 64 > 34.
 * (34 64 25 12 22 11 90) -> (34 25 64 12 22 11 90), Swap since 64 > 25
 * (34 25 64 12 22 11 90) -> (34 25 12 64 22 11 90), Swap since 64 > 12
 * (34 25 12 64 22 11 90) -> (34 25 12 22 64 11 90), Swap since 64 > 22
 * (34 25 12 22 64 11 90) -> (34 25 12 22 11 64 90), Swap since 64 > 11
 * (34 25 12 22 11 64 90) -> (34 25 12 22 11 64 90), Now, since these elements are already in order (90 > 64), algorithm does not swap them.
 * 
 * Then loop again from the beginning until end
