The Vashta Nerada lived in the darkness. They cast shadows when they entered
the light even stopping the reach of light from fission lamps. On their own,
outside of the darkness, a Vashta Nerada swarm looked like a shadow cast by nothing.
They mimicked the shadows of their prey to get close, which meant staying in the light was the only way to escape.
